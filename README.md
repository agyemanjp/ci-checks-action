# Create Github checks from script output files

## Description

Create Github checks (with annotations for pull request diffs) from the output (in a standard JSON format) of custom code check scripts. The annotations include a summary of errors and warnings, including links to the line numbers of any errors or warnings. It works on both pull requests (only on changed files) and pushes.


## Rationale

This action allows for more flexibility in implementing code checks. Instead on bundling specific checks, it allows you to use any custom script, as long as it outputs its results to a local JSON file in the proper format.

## Usage Example

In `.github/workflows/nodejs.yml`:

```yml
name: Example Workflow

on: [pull_request]

jobs:
  checks:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with: 
          persist-credentials: false

      - name: Setup Node.js 12.x
        uses: actions/setup-node@v1
        with:
          node-version: 12.x
      
      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: npm ci
        
      - name: Build
		run: npm run build --if-present
		
	- name: Run Lint Check
        run: npm run lint
        continue-on-error: true
        
      - name: Run Test Check
        run: npm run test
        continue-on-error: true

      - name: Annotate Checks
        uses: agyemanjp/ci-checks-action@1.0.1
        with:
          ghToken: "${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}"
          checks: "lint:.lint-report.json|test:.test-report.json"
```
